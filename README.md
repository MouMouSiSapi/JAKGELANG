This project is still being developed, I haven't added the ESP32 for communication from the app to the arduino but hopefully it works

the ESP32 is necessary for communication because of the same flagging but I haven't figured it out since my phone doesn't have any NFC available 

I'm Using:
Module: MFRC522 
Board: Arduino UNO 
Language: C++
